## Installation

The MoPub SDK supports multiple methods for installing into a project.

The current version of the SDK is 5.13.1

### Installation with CocoaPods

[CocoaPods](https://cocoapods.org/) is a dependency manager for Swift and Objective-C Cocoa projects, which automates and simplifies the process of using 3rd-party libraries like the MoPub SDK in your projects. You can install it with the following command:

```
$ gem install cocoapods
```

**Podfile**
To integrate MoPub SDK into your Xcode project using CocoaPods, specify it in your Podfile:

```
source 'https://github.com/CocoaPods/Specs.git'
platform :ios, '10.0'
use_frameworks!

target 'MyApp' do
  pod 'mopub-ios-sdk', '~> 5.13'
end
```

Then, run the following command:

```
$ pod install
```

### Manual Integration with Dynamic Framework

MoPub provides a prepackaged archive of the dynamic framework:

- **[MoPub SDK Framework.zip](https://github.com/mopub/mopub-ios-sdk/releases/download/5.13.1/mopub-framework-5.13.1.zip)**

  Includes everything you need to serve HTML, MRAID, and Native MoPub advertisements.  Third party ad networks are not included.

Add the dynamic framework to the target's Embedded Binaries section of the General tab.

### Manual Integration with Source Code

MoPub provides two prepackaged archives of source code:

- **[MoPub Base SDK.zip](https://github.com/mopub/mopub-ios-sdk/releases/download/5.13.1/mopub-base-5.13.1.zip)**

  Includes everything you need to serve HTML, MRAID, and Native MoPub advertisements.  Third party ad networks are not included.
